# FDO, Finite Domain Only the Solver

Fork of [finitedomain](https://github.com/the-grid/finitedomain) (package `finitedomain`), which is a fork of [FD.js](https://github.com/srikumarks/FD.js) (package `fdjs`).

## v0.0.1

Initial release. Basically the finitedomain fork, plus a few small bug fixes and some more syntax support, minus markov stuff and (non-dsl) api support.
